Digtial Image Process

Licence: MIT/X.

Java version: SE 1.8.

Time: 2014.10

The software is used to process image in some simple area. The main reason why I develop it is on the account of need of subject "Base of Digital Media", which is setted by School of Software Sun Yat-sen University.
But now, I don't care the score. The only thing I want is "make something interesting". As you can see that the quality of it has been beyond a homework' stantard (I think at least).
I welcom you help develop it from bottom of my heart. If you contribute some code, your name in github will be append after Author field, thanks.
